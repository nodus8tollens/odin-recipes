<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    This is a great recipe that I found in my Grandma's recipe book.
    Judging from the weathered look of this recipe card, this was a family favorite.
</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1½ cups of all-purpose flour </li>
    <li>3½ teaspoons of baking powder </li>
    <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>
    <li>1¼ cups of milk </li>
    <li>1 egg </li>
    <li>3 tablespoons of butter, melted </li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>In a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, salt and sugar.
        Make a well in the center and pour in the milk, egg and melted butter; mix until smooth.
    </li>
    <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat.
        Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake.
        Brown on both sides and serve hot.
    </li>
</ol>
